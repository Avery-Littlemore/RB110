## Problem
Check to see if the user's selections so far contain 2/3 of the elements within any of the WINNING_LINES subarrays. 
If yes, select the third of that WINNING_LINES subarray to defend against a loss.
Else, pick at random.

## Examples/Test Cases
[1,2]
[2,5]

## Data Structures
Comparing arrays to arrays and outputting an integer to be used as the target square

## Algorithm
Extract all of the user's positions on the board into an array format
  - get all user spots in hash
  - convert keys into array
  


Check to see which of the subarrays include one or more of the integers in the extracted array
Loop through those subarrays to see if there is more than one integer present from the extracted array
Select the third integer and output that as computer's choice

select

WINNING_LINES = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] +
                [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]] +
                [[1, 5, 9], [3, 5, 7]]
